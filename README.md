# Python Conditional Statements – README

## Aim:
To understand and implement decision-making in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements by solving a set of basic programming problems such as number checking, grading, date validation, salary calculation, and tax computation.

## Theory:
Conditional statements in Python allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.  
The `if` statement checks a condition, the `elif` statement checks additional conditions if the previous ones are false, and the `else` statement executes when none of the conditions are satisfied.  
These constructs are essential for controlling program flow and are widely used in real-world applications like grading systems, financial calculations, and date validation.

## Algorithm:
1. Accept input from the user using the `input()` function.
2. Convert the input to the required data type (integer or float).
3. Apply logical and relational operators to evaluate conditions.
4. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.
5. Perform calculations or operations as required (e.g., checking even/odd, leap year, tax calculation).
6. Display the result using the `print()` function.
7. For date-related programs:
   - Determine leap year status.
   - Identify the maximum number of days in a month.
   - Validate the date.
   - Increment the date correctly if valid.

## Conclusion:
Through these programs, the use of conditional statements in Python was successfully demonstrated. The exercises helped in understanding logical decision-making, handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and validating real-world data such as dates, salaries, and income. Mastery of these concepts forms a strong foundation for developing more complex Python applications.
